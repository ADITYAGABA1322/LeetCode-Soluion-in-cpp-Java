C++:


// Time Complexity : O(n) where n is the length of the array and space complexity is O(1)


class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int buy = INT_MIN, sell = 0, prev_sell = 0, prev_buy;  // variables to store the buy, sell, previous sell and previous buy
        for(int price: prices){  // iterate through the prices
            prev_buy = buy;  // update the previous buy
            buy = max(prev_sell - price, buy);  // update the buy
            prev_sell = sell;  // update the previous sell
            sell = max(prev_buy + price, sell);  // update the sell
        }
        return sell;  // return the sell
    }
};




Java:


// Time Complexity : O(n) where n is the length of the array and space complexity is O(1)


class Solution {

        int buy = Integer.MIN_VALUE, sell = 0, prev_sell = 0, prev_buy;  // variables to store the buy, sell, previous sell and previous buy
        for(int price: prices){  // iterate through the prices
            prev_buy = buy;  // update the previous buy
            buy = Math.max(prev_sell - price, buy);  // update the buy
            prev_sell = sell;  // update the previous sell
            sell = Math.max(prev_buy + price, sell);  // update the sell
        }
        return sell;  // return the sell
    }
